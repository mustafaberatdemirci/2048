## Introduction

This project aims to develop the popular 2048 game using Unity game engine. The game is about sliding numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to combine them and reach the 2048 tile. Your goal is to achieve the 2048 tile and get the highest score.

## Game Rules

- At the start, there are two "2" tiles placed randomly on the board.
- You can slide tiles using keyboard arrow keys or touchscreen swipes.
- Tiles move until they hit the board edge or collide with another tile.
